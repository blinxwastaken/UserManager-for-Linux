Friendly Linux Admin Scripts 🐧

This project is a growing collection of beginner-friendly Bash scripts designed to make Linux system administration easier and less intimidating.

The main goal is educational:
I’m building these tools to help teach Linux system administration in a practical, approachable way, especially for beginners who learn best by doing rather than memorizing commands.

(Originally created to help teach my girlfriend Linux sysadmin basics in a friendly way ❤️)

✨ What This Project Is:

Simple menu-driven Bash scripts focused on real sysadmin tasks written to be readable, modifiable, and safe to experiment with. No “magic” — the scripts show what Linux is actually doing.
